In this assignment, I wrote a program to estimate and visualize the value of the percolation threshold via Monte Carlo simulation. Important topics covered in this program include depth-first-search, union-find structures, and the use of computer simulations for statistical inquiry. After writing the program, I analyzed the Big O efficiencies of the differet search methods and came up with quantitative methods to empirically determine Big O runtimes.
